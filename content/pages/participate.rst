# What can I do at the docathon?
There are two main ways to get involved with the docathon.

First, you can offer a project that could use some documentation love. This might be an open-source package that is lacking in examples, that needs docstring improvements, or that simply needs somebody other than the author to make decisions about how to describe things. It could also be a tool or codebase that is designed to help with documentation or make it more effective.

Second, you can offer your own time during the docathon to work on the projects that are officially on-board. Alternatively, you can work on your own personal projects (so long as you're working on documentation!).

We'll have a list of projects with (mostly) clearly-defined projects that could be tackled over the course of the week. This will be the main watering hole for both listing and finding projects to work on.
